_A homework in Discrete Mathematics Class_

## RSA-Encryption
*The objective is to use Public key (n,e) and message (m) to compute ciphertext (c).*
### Input: 
* A test case consists of one line, which contains two integers n, e,and a string of the message (one word without any space).
* n and e are long long int
* Ex: 77 7 HI
### Output
* Your program must produce a single line, containing ASCII code of the message separate by comma (,).
* Ex: 30,17

## RSA-Decryption
*Use Public key (n,e) and ciphertext (c) to break RSAcryptography and compute message (m).*
### Input:
* A test case consists of one line, which contains two integers n, e, and a string of the ciphertext (numbers separated by comma).
* Ex: 221 5 89,99
* Ex: 2449500764025883 9800003 1041410691569662,1091330202595797,585214278497037,1072888762781599,
### Output
* Ex: HI
* Ex: 2018
